Kwiki-Formatter-Emphasis

This module was developed to fix what I consider a bug in Kwiki. The
documentation indicates that /foo/ mean to make "foo" italics. But the
implementation uses the <em> tag. It has used the <em> tag since the start but
it has always conveyed the message that your are making the text italics.

You may wonder why all this matters since most browsers render both tags the
same anyway? The reason is because we have a wiki where sometimes we want to
make text italics and other times we want to emphasize text. The styles are set
to make them look different so our wiki will not only carry the correct semantic
meaning but render the element visually different. Since people are used to the
idea that /foo/ means make it italics we didn't want to change that. But at the
same time we don't want our new syntax to use the <i> tag just because the <em>
tag is already being used because even if we style it how we want it won't
convey the correct symantic meaning.

So what this module does to correct the problem is it make /foo/ output
<i>foo</i> and makes ~foo~ output <em>foo</em>. This will break existing themes
that count of <em> meaning italics but we are only concerned about our theme
(and any theme that agrees with us).
